**Project Overview**

This project analyzes the video game console hardware market from the perspective of a market intelligence firm. The goal is to support **investment and market-sizing decisions** by quantifying hardware scale (units sold), estimated hardware revenue (proxy), and best-seller software pull-through (attach rate). Deliverables include an interactive Excel dashboard, a 1-page executive summary, a longer 4-page executive brief, and supporting visuals (screenshots + a dashboard demo GIF).

**Business Questions**

1. What is the total size of the console hardware market in this dataset under the current dashboard filters (units sold and estimated hardware revenue)?

2. Which consoles have the largest installed base (top consoles by units sold)?

3. Which consoles generate the most estimated hardware revenue (proxy)?

4. How do manufacturer unit share and revenue share compare, and what does that imply about monetization (value vs volume)?

5. Which consoles show the strongest best-seller software pull-through (best-seller attach rate)?

**Scope & filters:** Lifetime, ended consoles, gens 3–8, proxy revenue

**Key insights (5):** each with screenshot

**Methods/assumptions:** revenue proxy definition, attach-rate definition, filter sensitivity note

**Tools:** Excel, pivot/charts, dashboard design

**Dashboard Demo**
