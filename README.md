### Project Overview

This project analyzes the video game console hardware market from the perspective of a market intelligence firm. The goal is to support **investment and market-sizing decisions** by quantifying hardware scale (units sold), estimated hardware revenue (proxy), and best-seller software pull-through (attach rate). Deliverables include an interactive Excel dashboard, a 1-page executive summary, a longer 4-page executive brief, and supporting visuals (screenshots + a dashboard demo GIF).

### Business Questions

1. What is the total size of the console hardware market in this dataset under the current dashboard filters (units sold and estimated hardware revenue)?

2. Which consoles have the largest installed base (top consoles by units sold)?

3. Which consoles generate the most estimated hardware revenue (proxy)?

4. How do manufacturer unit share and revenue share compare, and what does that imply about monetization (value vs volume)?

5. Which consoles show the strongest best-seller software pull-through (best-seller attach rate)?

### Insight 1: Market baseline (filtered view)

**Headline:** Under the current dashboard filters, the console hardware market totals **~1.1B units** and **~$265.1B** in **estimated hardware revenue (proxy)**.

**What it means:** This establishes the **historical market scale** within the selected scope (3rd–8th generation consoles in the current filtered view), creating a consistent baseline for comparing consoles, manufacturers, and generations.

**Stakeholder takeaway:** Use this baseline as the reference point for **market sizing and investment comparisons** across segments (for example: installed base vs revenue capture vs software pull-through).

**Evidence:**

### Insight 2: Reach and dominance (units sold)

**Headline:** The top three consoles by lifetime units sold (**PlayStation 2, Nintendo DS, and Game Boy**) account for **~40% of all units** in the current filtered view (combined **~435M units**).

**What it means:** Installed base is **highly concentrated**, with a small number of platforms capturing a disproportionate share of total hardware adoption. The **PlayStation 2 leads at 160M units**, with the Nintendo DS close behind at 156M.

**Stakeholder takeaway:** Use these rankings to prioritize market-sizing and platform focus around ecosystems with historically proven reach, while validating platform choices using the relevant filter view (Lifetime vs As-Of, generations included).

**Evidence:**  


**Scope & filters:** Lifetime, ended consoles, gens 3–8, proxy revenue
